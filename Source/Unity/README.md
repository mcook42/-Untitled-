##Issues/fixes

 - Player not faceing correct direction when exiting building/just angle stuff
 
 - Scroll bar in map menu binds to the mouse wheel instead of the zoom unless the user clicks outside of the window/probably add zoom buttons instead
 
 - Long titles run into each other for threads in the thread room/make thread background prefab dynamically grow and move text up as needed.
 
 - 502 Gateway error on around 1/20 of the log in attempts / check for this error and try again?

 - Error menus hard to read / simple text wrap and change of alpha value.
 
 - Layout algorithm treats dome weird / treat dome as a single node or make layout algorithm static.
 
 - Comments don't appear when added. / call "addComment" in ReplyMenu if successful.
 
 - make different types of post more reconizable/ Add different colors and borders depending on the post.
 
 - Comment menu is slow to load / ????
 
 - Subreddits slow to load/ Make map menu more comprehensive/load in bulk
