#Chunk Loader pseudocode

The chunk loader class will be responsible for loading the chunks as needed. It will exist on top of an empty gameobject which will exist in the outside scene. 

For this code, I am making the assumption that the building positions, names, and models are being stored somewhere else.

##Class: chunk loader

###Fields/information needed:

 - Chunks loaded at once: A positive integer representing how many chunks are loaded at a time.
 
 - The chunks: An array holding the current chunks.
 
 - Player/camera info: Will need to get this info externally.
 
 - Building prefabs
 
 - Street/scenary prefabs
 
 - Neighborhood x size: Number of buildings in between streets.
 
###Methods

 - Test for new chunks: Looks at the player position, the chunk the player is inside, and the camera position to determine if new chunks need to be loaded.
 
 - Load new chunks: Input which ever "side" new chunks need to be loaded. Then, distroy chunks on the opposite side and load new chunks onto the other side.
 
     - Loading might need to take place in the background. May need to load on a scene by scene basis.
	 
	 - First, load the new chunks. 
	 
	    - Find the relevant building positions of the adjecent chunks. Uses these to calculate the next building positions.
		
		- Use GetBuilding to grab new buildings. Store these in a vector.
		
		- Instantiate buildings. Set positions based on positions of old buildings. Set rotations. 
		
		- Instantiate/store the streets. Put a new street every two buildings along the z-axis and every Neiborhood_x_size along the x-axis.
		
		- Go through the old chunks and destroy all objects within them.
 
 - GetBuilding(x,y): Gets the building at x,y. This method may make a call to the server in the future.

 
##Class: Chunk, a simple class used to store all relevant chunk data.

 - Buildings: all buildings within the chunk.
 
 - Scenary: all scenary within the chunk.
 
 - Chunk Size: An adjustable integer recording how many buildings exist within one chunk.
 
 - Chunk Position: position of top left most building within the chunk?
 
##Class: Building, a class associated with every building. Stores all building information.

 - Name: subreddit name.

 - Position: (x,y) coordinates. NOT the position of the gameobject, but rather the position of the building with respect to all of the other buildings
 
 - Model used.
