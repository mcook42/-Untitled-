THINGS LEFT TO DO

TODO(MATT):
    -From client's subreddit request, return map of connected nodes in a JSON format
    -LIMIT connections to 15?
    -Make buildings pretty
    -Make menus pretty 
        -Every menu has a panel, then layout element

TODO(KAY):
    -Client to Server requests. Like setting up threading or whatever on the server side. Steps are as follows.
