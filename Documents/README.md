#Introduction

We aim to create a 3D city based off of the popular social media site Reddit. In the city, a building will be created for every Subreddit on Reddit. Inside the building, a room will be created for every thread within that Subreddit. Inside every room, stick figure characters will be created for every comment within that thread. Through interaction with these objects, the user will be able to view/interact with Reddit in a three dimensional setting. We make the assumption that our users will already be familiar with Reddit's structure and features.

##Stakeholders and Goals:

1. People with experience using Reddit:

  Our application will provide this stakeholder with an alternative method of viewing Reddit. This stakeholder will be able to view posts and comments, travel around our world, and create/login to a Reddit account using the objects and features provided in our three dimensional world.

2. People with a Reddit account: 
 
 In addition to viewing Reddit content, this stakeholder will be able to create posts and comments, create bookmarks, view and edit their account profile (bookmarks, mailbox, karma, trophies, and saved comments), give gold, and manage friends.
 
3. Reddit Admins/Moderators: 

 Performing moderator and administrator actions is not within the scope of our application. 
 
4. Reddit: 

 In order to get data from Reddit, our application will request data in the specific format that Reddit outlines [here](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2).
 
5. Server: 

 In order to request data from Reddit, we will use a server. The server will request data from Reddit, store this data in a database, and then send the data to our application upon request. The goal of our server is to keep itself updated with Reddit content and provide this content to our application upon request.
